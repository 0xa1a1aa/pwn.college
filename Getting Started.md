1. Challenges are in the directory `/challenge`
2. Flags are stored in the `/flag` file.
3. You can launch challenges in two modes: **Start** and **Practice** (administrative privileges via `sudo`, fake flag)
4. Your home directory `/home/hacker` in the dojo is persistent between challenges (e.g. to reference old solutions, rerun solutions perfected in Practice mode against challenges in non-Practice mode)

Connect to the challenge machine via SSH:
- Start the machine
- `ssh hacker@pwn.college`
