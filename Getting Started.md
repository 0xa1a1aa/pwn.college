1. Flags are stored in the `/flag` file.
2. You can launch challenges in two modes: **Start** and **Practice** (administrative privileges via `sudo`, fake flag)
3. Your home directory `/home/hacker` in the dojo is persistent between challenges (e.g. to reference old solutions, rerun solutions perfected in Practice mode against challenges in non-Practice mode)
